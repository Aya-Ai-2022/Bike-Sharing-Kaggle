# EDA and Prediction of Bike Sharing Demand dataset from Kaggle 



* This project aims to predict the number of bikes rented in a bike sharing system based on various attributes such as the season , weather, temperature, holiday, working day, and time.


* The implementation of the Bike Sharing Demand EDA and Prediction is done using Python and various machine learning and statistical libraries such as pandas , NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

* The first step I loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform some exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure, distribution, and relationships between the features.

* Then,to preprocess the dataset by encoding the categorical attributes using one-hot encoding, scaling the numerical attributes, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

* Finally,I trained and evaluated a machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset using various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

* The performance of the model was evaluated using  (MSl) and R-squared.
* Matplotlib can be used to visualize the evaluation results and make predictions.
